# Food Quality Detection (Landing AI)

## 📌 Problem Statement
Food safety and quality is a critical issue in the food industry.  
This project focuses on **detecting food quality (good vs. defective/rotten items)** using **computer vision** on the LandingLens (Landing AI) platform.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- LandingLens (Landing AI) – No-code AI/ML platform
- Image Classification (Computer Vision)
- Cloud-based training and deployment
- QR Code for live demo testing

## 🚀 Approach
1. Collected a dataset of food images (good quality vs. bad quality).  
2. Labeled data and trained the classification model on LandingLens.  
3. Evaluated performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.  
4. Deployed the trained model with QR code access for real-time demo.  

## 📊 Results
- **Training Accuracy:** 99%  
- **Dev Set Accuracy:** 97%  
- Confusion Matrix shows clear separation of good vs. defective food.  
- Model deployed successfully with QR code access.
